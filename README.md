Penguin is a dev server featuring live-reloading, a file server, proxy support, and more.
It is language and framework agnostic, so it works for basically any web project.
Browser sessions can reload themselves (e.g. when a file changes) or show an overlay with a custom message (e.g. the compiler error).

Penguin is available both as a command line application (`penguin-app` on crates.io) and as a library. For for more information on the library, see [its documentation](https://docs.rs/penguin). The rest of this document will mainly talk about the CLI app.
